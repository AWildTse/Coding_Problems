Hi! I've been struggling to find a way to showcase some practical coding abilities since I can't post any work from my previous position as a Unity3D/Virtual Reality Developer, so for now I will be posting some LeetCode problem solutions in this repository until
I can figure out what type of project I would like to create to demonstrate my working knowledge of C#.
